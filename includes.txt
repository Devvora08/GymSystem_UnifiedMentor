member home page style 
so it has similar navbar, on left is the welcome -"membername", with links on right side, then comes upcoming events and classes, now it doesnt have to be from collection or somewhere, it will be simply made up,
 a container having 3 boxes in a row, with timings, admin contacts for joining, and details about it, then comes the recent notifications, only the most recent one in a well
  designed container below these event section, then after this comes the new offer like scheme, that displays the premium, gold, 
  and premium-gold plans from my plan-collection with discounts and offer cuts and all, with a live timer in each box, similar like events box, and at last comes my membership status, paid/unpaid with a small bills reciept.
   The body background is an image of a gym wallpaper i want to display, with all these boxes having cool glass morphs colors that show the background well. just review my idea . no code yet
